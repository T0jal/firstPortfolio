# My First Portfolio Web Page

On this project I created a webpage to serve as a portfolio. As it was my first attemp at this I used only HTML, CSS & Vanilla JavaScript.

Main points of interest:

-   Mobile First architecture;
-   No CSS library was used.




## Demo

The webpage can be seen live at www.tojal.pt (today, 16.07.2021. It will most likely be changed overtime.)
